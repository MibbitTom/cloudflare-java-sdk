## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**dnssecMultiSigner** | **Boolean** | If true, multi-signer DNSSEC is enabled on the zone, allowing multiple providers to serve a DNSSEC-signed zone at the same time. This is required for DNSKEY records (except those automatically generated by Cloudflare) to be added to the zone.  See [Multi-signer DNSSEC](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/dnssec/multi-signer-dnssec/) for details. |  [optional] |
|**dnssecPresigned** | **Boolean** | If true, allows Cloudflare to transfer in a DNSSEC-signed zone including signatures from an external provider, without requiring Cloudflare to sign any records on the fly.  Note that this feature has some limitations. See [Cloudflare as Secondary](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-secondary/setup/#dnssec) for details. |  [optional] |
|**status** | [**StatusEnum**](#StatusEnum) | Status of DNSSEC, based on user-desired state and presence of necessary records. |  [optional] |
